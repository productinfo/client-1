# Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pepibumur/client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pepibumur/client)

Client is an HTTP client for Swift inspired by the [objc.io networking talk](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E01-networking)

## Setup

Add the following line to your `Podfile` and execute `pod install`:

```ruby
pod "Client", :git => "https://github.com/pepibumur/Client.git"
```

## Usage

```swift
// Create an instance of your client
let client = Client(baseURLComponents: URLComponents(string: "https://api.myservice.com")!) { request in 
    // You can use this adapter to inject headers in the requests (e.g. session token)
    return request
}

// Define the models that we get from the API
struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
}

// Define API resources
extension User {
    // A resource defines:
    // 1: How the request is generated from base URL components.
    // 2. How the response data is parsed into the model. 
    var me: Resource<User> {
        return Resource.jsonResource { (components: URLComponents) -> URLRequest in
            var mutableComponents = components
            mutableComponents.path = "/me"
            var request = URLRequest(url: mutableComponents.url!)
            request.httpMethod = "GET"
            return request
        }
    }
}

// We pass the resource to the client with a callback that gets
// notified when the request and parsing completes
client.execute(resource: User.me) { (result) in
    if let error = result.error {
        
    } else if let value = result.value {
        
    }
}
```
